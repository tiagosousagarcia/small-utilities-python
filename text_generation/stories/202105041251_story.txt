There once was a man from Nuntucket, a town that hadmany fishermen. The fishermen all wanted to make a living, but there was not a single fish to be seen in the sea. The only fish to be seen was a dead yellow flounder. The man from Nuntucket was walking along the beach one day when he saw the poor flounder, floundering next to the sea. "Wow, it's a good thing," he says, pointing to theflounder, "there is life in the sea after all!"
