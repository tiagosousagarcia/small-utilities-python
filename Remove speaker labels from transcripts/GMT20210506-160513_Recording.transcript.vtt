00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.880
James Cummings: hi everyone and welcome to our most recent at new virtual visiting speaker.

2
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.180
James Cummings: And this time it's crystal struck, who is a professor of digital humanities at the University of treasure in Germany and co director of the career Center for digital humanities he's also.

3
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:43.560
James Cummings: Chair of the coast action distant reading for European literary history and President of the digital humanities Association for the German speaking area and tonight he's going to talk to us about computation or literary studies goes multi lingual challenges and lessons learned.

4
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.620
Christof Sch?ch: kristof yeah.

5
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000
Christof Sch?ch: Welcome everyone it's great to be here thanks James for the invitation.

6
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.410
Christof Sch?ch: yeah.

7
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.550
Christof Sch?ch: competition or the Tuesday studies scores multilingual.

8
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.610
Christof Sch?ch: I will share my screen now hope everybody can see that.

9
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.790
Christof Sch?ch: yeah challenges and lessons learned so first of all, before I even get going.

10
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.710
Christof Sch?ch: This is really.

11
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.760
Christof Sch?ch: This talk is about a collaborative project so.

12
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:33.180
Christof Sch?ch: lots of people have been working on this on this project that i'm going to use as the main example of some of the challenges and lessons learned.

13
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.790
Christof Sch?ch: In multilingual competition or do studies and they they all contributed over the last three years to the cross section that was just mentioned.

14
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.190
Christof Sch?ch: Already distant reading for European literary history, so this is really a collaborative talk and.

15
00:01:47.820 --> 00:02:04.410
Christof Sch?ch: Some of the things I talked about i've been involved very closely, others less closely because there's there's a lot of different things going on in this in this cross section, obviously, so why the focus on the Multi lingual aspect I think it's really.

16
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.030
Christof Sch?ch: it's really a recent trend in the last couple of years that this issue has seen a lot more visibility.

17
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.450
Christof Sch?ch: And just to pick just one example, one of my favorite examples is the data sitters club that Quinn dombroski and others animate.

18
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:35.880
Christof Sch?ch: That is really programmatically multilingual and many other examples, and so the l tech and construction example is really one one in a whole series of such projects.

19
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.650
Christof Sch?ch: Now.

20
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.110
Christof Sch?ch: What I want to talk about Basically, this is my business to have you have my talk i'll briefly introduce our tech.

21
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:56.220
Christof Sch?ch: And then talk about some issues in a bit more detail the composition criteria of this corpus encoding principles publication strategy.

22
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:06.720
Christof Sch?ch: And usage scenarios and I will put a focus on the composition criteria and the use of scenarios and just touch quickly on encoding principles and publication strategy.

23
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:17.310
Christof Sch?ch: Before I conclude, very briefly, so what is what is our tech, first of all, so it means European literary texts collection and it is.

24
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.410
Christof Sch?ch: being produced in the context of the cross section distant reading for European history, which is a research network.

25
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.220
Christof Sch?ch: That has been developed over the last has been developing over the last three three and a half years.

26
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.950
Christof Sch?ch: By now, they are 31 countries involved, mostly Europe but also in the US, the US is involved and Australia, for example.

27
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:58.500
Christof Sch?ch: And they about 200 researchers who have in some shape or other been involved in the in the action the central ambition really is to foster digital cross lingual research into the history of the European novel and we could argue about the terms multilingual and cross lingual.

28
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.270
Christof Sch?ch: And really.

29
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:20.760
Christof Sch?ch: I think the term cross lingual actually is, the better match here because we're not just trying to do, multiple languages independently alongside each other in a way, but we really try to enable research that that works on multiple connections, at the same time.

30
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.680
Christof Sch?ch: We try to yeah and we'll see how that how that works.

31
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:36.360
Christof Sch?ch: So the construction has a number of areas of areas of activity, obviously, so, first of all, we want to build that multilingual corpus of the European novel.

32
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.270
Christof Sch?ch: Which is what i'm focusing on today, as well as on the second point, we want to develop.

33
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.730
Christof Sch?ch: And also evaluate and use appropriate digital methods of analysis so appropriate for that multilingual material.

34
00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:03.270
Christof Sch?ch: We want to think about the theoretical theoretical consequences of having digital data using digital methods for core concepts in literary history and literary theory, such as.

35
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:12.510
Christof Sch?ch: authorship period ization canonization things like that we of course want to create a network of researchers across Europe that.

36
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:24.030
Christof Sch?ch: That do this kind of research, and that has really been been happening and i'm very pleased about this, and this involves as well, capacity building, so we organize training, schools.

37
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:41.190
Christof Sch?ch: short term exchanges between researchers and we have been able to launch a couple of projects in different constellations of action participants that take what we started further or deeper in in various areas.

38
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:51.630
Christof Sch?ch: So i'll take the European literal texts collection what is that it's a corpus of the European novel for the time period 1842 1920.

39
00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:03.870
Christof Sch?ch: And I think that question that we get most about lt is really why that period, why does it start in 1840, why does it end in 1920 and there are lots of reasons actually.

40
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:14.190
Christof Sch?ch: Mainly, they are related to four points, the first is production, so if we think about German, English and French.

41
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:24.480
Christof Sch?ch: Then there's no need to start as late as that, because the novel was already very actively you produced, even in the 17th and 18th centuries.

42
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:39.840
Christof Sch?ch: However, that's not the case in all of the European languages and European literary traditions that we look at so some of them started their own tradition of the novel only in the course of the 19th century, then there's the topic of availability.

43
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:51.720
Christof Sch?ch: The 19th century novel has been digitized a lot more than than the previous periods so it's a question of you know feasibility, can we pull this off.

44
00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:06.750
Christof Sch?ch: there's a technical aspect related to ocr optical character recognition, it is it works, a lot better for 19th century materials, then for 18th century materials, for example, depending on the printing traditions in the different countries.

45
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:16.260
Christof Sch?ch: And finally, copyright is really the main reason that we stopped in 1920 because, with the European standard regime of copyright ending.

46
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:27.810
Christof Sch?ch: 70 years after the death of the author of a given novel of a given texts that means that if we stop in 1920 most of the novice that we would like to include.

47
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.080
Christof Sch?ch: are no longer under copyright are so so that we can publish them openly, which is of course what we wanted to be able to do.

48
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:48.150
Christof Sch?ch: Second, key goal or characteristic of LTE is that we plan to provide at least 10 different European languages collections in 10 different languages.

49
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:59.790
Christof Sch?ch: And at the moment we have eight of them complete so we're almost at that 10 and we have not just two more in progress, but 10 more in progress so there's a lot of interest in the.

50
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:06.990
Christof Sch?ch: Among the actual participants to have their national traditional their language based tradition present as well.

51
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.880
Christof Sch?ch: And then, these are not just any 100 novels language, but the idea is that the collections are roughly comparable.

52
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.850
Christof Sch?ch: between each other and that's why the composition criteria will be so important that we'll talk about them in a minute.

53
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:30.180
Christof Sch?ch: So some more key characteristics each corpus is meant to represent the variety of production so it's not about.

54
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:41.550
Christof Sch?ch: Producing a statistical sample that would be statistically representative of the of the population of the overall production but.

55
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:50.340
Christof Sch?ch: We can't do that because we in almost all of the cases we don't know we don't have that population defined.

56
00:08:51.210 --> 00:09:01.590
Christof Sch?ch: For the British novel that's the case, there is a bibliography for some other traditions it's, also the case, but generally we don't have that information, so we can't we can't do that.

57
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:11.070
Christof Sch?ch: And also, even if we did that would be practical other practical limitations in terms of you know, having to digitize most of what we would like to include.

58
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:24.420
Christof Sch?ch: The text are all encoded in xml ti and our will be linguistically annotated, especially for part of speech and named entities and, of course, everything is published under open licenses.

59
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:36.540
Christof Sch?ch: The texts themselves are in the public domain anyways and we don't we try not to place unnecessary restrictions on you know anything else metadata encoding etc.

60
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:46.590
Christof Sch?ch: You can find out more about Ltd under the link that is presented here, and the latest release is from April so pretty recent.

61
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:58.710
Christof Sch?ch: With 14 different collections, not all of them complete but for total of 1200 novels So you see that the average is somewhere in the 1980s or 90s for for each collection.

62
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:10.800
Christof Sch?ch: Now this is, this is the overview of the current state of the corpus and you see that there are 18 collections and 18 different languages.

63
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:20.490
Christof Sch?ch: And so on the left in the right frame you see the languages, on the one hand, and then the number of texts that are included.

64
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:33.900
Christof Sch?ch: And you can see, this we are we have collections at all stages of the process, some of them are complete with 100 novels others are somewhere in the middle, with let's say 8458 and some are really starting out.

65
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.680
Christof Sch?ch: With just two or in the low 20s different collections and we have well.

66
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:53.040
Christof Sch?ch: A few more months, maybe a bit more to go, and so we hope to complete, as many of these collections as possible, but for some languages, it will, it will be tough and we will not reach the 100 novels but even then.

67
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.010
Christof Sch?ch: You know, some some of the languages have really not seen such corporate online and at all.

68
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:15.570
Christof Sch?ch: Now let's go into the first of the core issues, the composition criteria for Celtic so first of all, they are some eligibility criteria, so what kinds of texts can be included at all, no way, so they have to be novels.

69
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:23.190
Christof Sch?ch: And we have a very minimal definition of what a novelist we just say its narrative fictional pros of a certain length.

70
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:34.770
Christof Sch?ch: And we don't formally define narrative and fictional and pros, but we do formula define the minimum length criterion, they have to be at least 10,000 words.

71
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:45.390
Christof Sch?ch: Which is debatable and arbitrary, obviously, but it sounded like a good idea to time but to be honest, the length criteria and we'll get to.

72
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:52.200
Christof Sch?ch: It in a bit more detail in a minute is one of the most controversial criteria that we have surprisingly.

73
00:11:52.830 --> 00:12:00.810
Christof Sch?ch: So all the novels have to be written originally in the language of the collection, so that no translations in there again pretty debatable, but that's what we set out to do.

74
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:12.690
Christof Sch?ch: And we would like those novels to have been published, either at for immediately at first in the first publication, or at least as well in Europe so that they participate in the European tradition of the know.

75
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:25.980
Christof Sch?ch: Because, after all, it's a you funded project so that seemed seemed fair and we do we it's it's already a big the scope is already quite big so we needed to put a limit on it somewhere.

76
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:34.650
Christof Sch?ch: Now the composition criteria, a little bit more complex, they have, as the key objective to ensure this compatibility of the collections.

77
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:44.610
Christof Sch?ch: but also to make sure that we really do represent the diversity of the novel production and in doing so that we go beyond the canon and beyond.

78
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:55.890
Christof Sch?ch: The novels that you usually find online anyways so, because otherwise there's no real added value to this particular collection of corpus.

79
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:08.940
Christof Sch?ch: Now the criteria we do take into account, are the following so and sorry for there's a missing translation and because the slides are multilingual as well, they are available in three different languages.

80
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:29.700
Christof Sch?ch: So, and here there's a missing translation, so that the period of publication that should be we have we just split the period into four periods and we try to have novels having a similar proportion of novels from each of these periods, so that we can we don't compare you know, the French.

81
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:42.360
Christof Sch?ch: Early 19th century novels to the British late 19th century novels but that really every collection has a bit of everything similarly for the length of the.

82
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:55.260
Christof Sch?ch: Of the novels we simply distinguish between short, medium and long novels the short ones up to 50,000 words and the long ones are over 100,000 words.

83
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:06.000
Christof Sch?ch: And I said this is controversial and it is indeed because we noticed and really that's a learning process we didn't really know in the beginning, when we set out.

84
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.400
Christof Sch?ch: In every language based literary tradition.

85
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.620
Christof Sch?ch: The distribution of novel length can be quite different.

86
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.170
Christof Sch?ch: So some traditions, for example, to Greek.

87
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:38.040
Christof Sch?ch: novel tradition doesn't have a lot of long novels and for them actually these criteria are too strict and they will have a very hard time finding one third 130 around 30 long novels at all.

88
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:54.000
Christof Sch?ch: And, in other cases it's more the case that, for certain time periods let's say the early 20th century with the modernist novel when others tend to be shorter in that period it's it might be difficult to find long novels.

89
00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.500
Christof Sch?ch: In other cases it's it's particularly combinations with author gender that are rare and.

90
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:10.560
Christof Sch?ch: So we don't just look at each criteria on separately, but also in combination, so we try to have a certain proportion of.

91
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:25.500
Christof Sch?ch: novels by male and female authors, overall, but also within each time period and that makes these criteria actually really challenging and we don't have perfect results obviously everywhere.

92
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.990
Christof Sch?ch: yeah author gender is another controversial one, because again.

93
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:46.170
Christof Sch?ch: A number of novels written by female authors is first of all, not clearly known in all traditions, it can also diverged considerably between different traditions.

94
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:59.940
Christof Sch?ch: So for the British Navi we found out because there's this very good bibliography that really there are about 50% of the novels written by female authors, which surprised me and I could hardly believe it.

95
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:09.930
Christof Sch?ch: But, but that seems to be the case, whereas in other traditions We only know of novels by female authors.

96
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:21.420
Christof Sch?ch: that make up maybe 10% of the production and so what is an appropriate proportion, should it be proportionate to what we know about the individual traditions.

97
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:33.120
Christof Sch?ch: Should it always be 5050 then it's impossible for some of the collections, but what about compatibility, then so we ended up saying you have to have at least 10% of the novels written by a.

98
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:44.520
Christof Sch?ch: Female authors and it can be up to 50% and, ideally, it would be somewhere in between, which is really a pretty complex way of defining.

99
00:16:45.150 --> 00:17:02.520
Christof Sch?ch: Seemingly seemingly simple formal criterion, and not even speaking about the diverse and mixed category and the category of authors, who used a different gender pen name to their let's say biological.

100
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.770
Christof Sch?ch: Sex now.

101
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:12.660
Christof Sch?ch: And then there's the criterion of the reprint count, which is really a way of measuring or operationalize.

102
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:16.320
Christof Sch?ch: The level of anonymity of a novel.

103
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:23.490
Christof Sch?ch: And we made a point of looking at that, in this time period 1972 2010.

104
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.050
Christof Sch?ch: around you know 1989 basically.

105
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:47.130
Christof Sch?ch: So we wanted to make sure that we would include similar proportions of novels that are still being read regularly today or in the recent past let's say and others that were more or less forgotten in more recent times.

106
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:59.190
Christof Sch?ch: Last criterion, the number of novels for author nine to 11 authors can be represented, with three novels and everything else should be one novel by one author.

107
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:12.960
Christof Sch?ch: This really has the purpose of making sure that on the one hand we can do some authorship attribution experiments and for those you need office represented, with more than one novel.

108
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:22.170
Christof Sch?ch: But on the other hand, we want to you know we have this goal of representing the diversity of the novel production, and for that it's simply necessary to make sure that.

109
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:43.500
Christof Sch?ch: Many different authors are represented at not so that no collection is dominated you know by a few famous very productive usually male authors like you know PASOK Zola and they haven't in the French collection, for example, or Dickens let's say in the for the British collection.

110
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.890
Christof Sch?ch: yeah the result.

111
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:56.640
Christof Sch?ch: does look quite varied depending on the collection, that you look at on the left, we have the British novel a collection.

112
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:12.060
Christof Sch?ch: That has 100 novels and it has what we call it easy five actually if i've see it's the l tech corpus composition criteria compliance score something like that.

113
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:28.080
Christof Sch?ch: And it has a perfect score, and you can see that the well chosen colors pink and blue here for the agenda for each sub period and each length category give a pretty balanced.

114
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:40.470
Christof Sch?ch: picture, for example here on the top right, you would have short novels of the first time period, and they are two novels by a female Office and to buy male authors, this is what this.

115
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:50.310
Christof Sch?ch: mosaic plot basically shows, and you see that it's very equally distributed among the different categories, whereas for the Romanian collection on the right.

116
00:19:51.420 --> 00:20:02.790
Christof Sch?ch: it's the pictures a little bit different actually it's, this is not the right, this is, this is not the right image, let me just improve on this.

117
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.790
Christof Sch?ch: This is the English one again so let's let's look at the Romanian one.

118
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.350
Christof Sch?ch: Yes, this is the Romanian one, so this is what we should be looking at i'm sorry for that little mix up.

119
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:31.170
Christof Sch?ch: And you see first of all, the distribution in the time period is very different and very unbalanced in a way, much more challenging situation and the gender distribution is.

120
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.100
Christof Sch?ch: Not as equally distributed.

121
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:56.070
Christof Sch?ch: It does fulfill the criteria of at least 10% novels by female authors, but it cannot achieve that kind of balance that we saw in the English collection, simply because of the the production, but also the state of the digitization and so let's go let's try and go back.

122
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.540
Christof Sch?ch: here.

123
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:08.970
Christof Sch?ch: So it's much more difficult to obtain the balance here, and this leads to Basically, this is just one example, and every collection has its own you know challenges.

124
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:21.720
Christof Sch?ch: But what it leads to basically is the is what I call the diversity paradox, so we have three competing objectives here one is compatibility of the collections and that.

125
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:42.360
Christof Sch?ch: is basically enabled by strict criteria, because you have to have some you know non canonized authors some novels by female authors some you know from each of the time periods, and if you if you're very strict with this you basically automatically are forced to to have similar collections.

126
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.220
Christof Sch?ch: Second.

127
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:53.310
Christof Sch?ch: objective is this broad diversity of texts and again strict criteria basically automatically lead to that if you respect them.

128
00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:00.780
Christof Sch?ch: However, we also aim at the diversity of the literary traditions represented in our tech, so we do we don't.

129
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:13.260
Christof Sch?ch: We do want to have you know, the Hungarian and Romanian Serbian and the Ukrainian collection in there, and for them if the criteria are too strict.

130
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:37.770
Christof Sch?ch: They simply can't put together a collection, so we need to balance these two competing needs and key strategy to respond to this challenge has been to have these flexible targets in a way, so to say, at least 10% novels by female authors ideally around 30 and you can have up to 50.

131
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:49.200
Christof Sch?ch: That means that compatibility is some what ensured a certain minimum of diversity is also insured, but the bar is not too high for those languages.

132
00:22:49.590 --> 00:23:01.170
Christof Sch?ch: For those literary traditions, where there hasn't been a lot of production by female authors or we don't know about it, or it hasn't been digitized or we cannot digitize enough of it in a way to include it.

133
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:10.800
Christof Sch?ch: So that's that's basically our attempt to sneak out of this conundrum or this diversity paradox.

134
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:23.400
Christof Sch?ch: So I know this has been a pretty technical part with these criteria, but we do get a lot of questions about this, so I thought it's worth spending a bit of time on it now let's move on to some of the.

135
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.710
Christof Sch?ch: Easier parts.

136
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:45.180
Christof Sch?ch: encoding principles there's nothing really magical happening there, especially if you are in an xml ti person or someone fluent in digital editing, it is very simple xml ti, but we do have three levels of encoding.

137
00:23:47.100 --> 00:24:00.600
Christof Sch?ch: A level zero with really minimal ti encoding whether you have some metadata and a header that is pretty standard across all levels and then simply a little bit of structure the chapters and the paragraphs and maybe some some.

138
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:12.990
Christof Sch?ch: Some highlights like it's Alex but really not a lot more than we have a level one encoding that is a bit more semantic in a way, so we try to convert those those high.

139
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:24.300
Christof Sch?ch: Those high markup into things like foreign for foreign phrases or words and m for emphasis etc or titles.

140
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.630
Christof Sch?ch: And then we have a level two, which is.

141
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:36.060
Christof Sch?ch: ti with token level linguistic annotation especially part of speech, but also named entities and but Level two is really still.

142
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:55.470
Christof Sch?ch: In development now for the slightly technically inclined, this is, of course, controlled by a set of schemas the schemas are connected with each other, via this process of changing that James might may be able to explain better than I, I can.

143
00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.230
Christof Sch?ch: that's something that Luke put in place Lupo not who is working with us.

144
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:10.080
Christof Sch?ch: So we have validation with real accidentally schemas and schema tron to be able to also check, you know certain structural constraints.

145
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:26.370
Christof Sch?ch: And the validation is social enforced, as I like to say bye Lupo not who really make sure that we don't publish anything that hasn't been validated we do try to avoid his scrutiny, but he usually catches us at some point.

146
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.510
Christof Sch?ch: yeah then of course we acquired some metadata.

147
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:37.440
Christof Sch?ch: The competition, I mean the data that we need in order to check the composition criteria, of course, is coated there.

148
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:47.010
Christof Sch?ch: there's some provenance information, the digital source that we use the print source that it relies on or that it comes from, if we know it, and the first edition of the novel.

149
00:25:48.180 --> 00:26:00.150
Christof Sch?ch: Whenever we we know it, which we usually do then optionally the type of the novel, for example, to sub genre of the novel or the narrative perspective is it a memoir novel or is it a third person novel things like that.

150
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.050
Christof Sch?ch: But these are optional, because they are really tricky to.

151
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:13.200
Christof Sch?ch: To a certain in many cases, especially the sexual information and, if you want to model this correctly, you need to do more than just put some keywords.

152
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:22.410
Christof Sch?ch: There, and finally, some texture characteristics, especially whether we modernize the text or not, or whether we use a modernized text or an original one.

153
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:41.190
Christof Sch?ch: The alphabet whether it's a Latin or Cyrillic alphabet or some transition alphabet, for example in Romanian we have some a phase where some transition alphabet is used, honestly, I can tell you much more about that, and of course the encoding level that is that that that the version has.

154
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.190
Christof Sch?ch: The alphabet issue is, by the way, something that I completely underestimated.

155
00:26:47.940 --> 00:27:01.440
Christof Sch?ch: and several of our language traditions change alphabets in the course of that period 1842 1920, for example, Serbian and Romanian with this transition alphabet and others had.

156
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:10.950
Christof Sch?ch: Language normalization pushes that that I didn't expect to happen late in the 19th century, but they do and it's really.

157
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:25.560
Christof Sch?ch: it's really simply ignorance on my part on our part, when we designed the project and we learned a lot about the incredible diversity of the histories of the novels in different countries already just by trying to do this.

158
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:37.590
Christof Sch?ch: Now the publication strategy is also very simple, on the one hand, it is oriented towards the needs of the project, so we use github as the space where we collaborate, where we curate those connections.

159
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:52.560
Christof Sch?ch: We publish releases regularly with a dui through the nodal and that's where you can also download them as a zip package and where you can graph well where were the references to do I references will lead you.

160
00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:03.120
Christof Sch?ch: We have this overview that I already showed on on github as well, and then for the needs of distribution in a way beyond the normal.

161
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:14.820
Christof Sch?ch: We are currently experimenting with different platforms, one of them is ti publisher another is the gums platform from god's university or the text with repository.

162
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:24.180
Christof Sch?ch: From gutting and state and university library and, hopefully, we have a new project a follow up project called CLS in for.

163
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:38.790
Christof Sch?ch: That is that we have just that we're just launching and hopefully we will be able to publish ltv through that platform as well just to give you an idea how this looks like this is the starting page of the github.

164
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:47.340
Christof Sch?ch: organization for our tech where you see some of the people, contributing here on the right to the various Cobra.

165
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:54.780
Christof Sch?ch: This is there's another Community where all these different corporate end up, and this is an example, one example of the.

166
00:28:55.650 --> 00:29:00.960
Christof Sch?ch: Of the distribution platforms that we experiment with here to to a publisher and you see on the left.

167
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:10.980
Christof Sch?ch: The facets language period author gender size and reprint count that allow you to put together, you know your own custom designed.

168
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:23.190
Christof Sch?ch: Sub collection across languages are focused on by gender or time period or size of the numbers, etc, and then you know download them as a package for analysis, for example.

169
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:38.490
Christof Sch?ch: So last point, and this, I will develop a little bit more, but actually it's just some examples as well, so usage scenarios for analytics or multilingual analysis scenarios, there are a couple of them.

170
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:51.270
Christof Sch?ch: They all share some objectives we are trying to adapt existing statistical methods to these multiple European languages and we try to evaluate these methods in a multilingual across lingual context.

171
00:29:51.900 --> 00:30:00.360
Christof Sch?ch: And, in particular, I think something that that is becomes possible now with our tech is to go beyond you know the usual suspects.

172
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:13.110
Christof Sch?ch: English, German and French and really look into more languages that have received a lot less attention when these kinds of methods are being developed so the examples I will mention on.

173
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.890
Christof Sch?ch: Our include include the following.

174
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:30.450
Christof Sch?ch: So there's work on linguistic annotation, how can we annotate all these multiple languages in a way that will allow comparative analysis, so we we.

175
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:42.600
Christof Sch?ch: The challenge really is that each language will use a different tagore or tagging model, and so a different tax ID as well, and we need to match.

176
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:53.700
Christof Sch?ch: To map those taxes on to share tax ID so that we can make meaningful comparisons between the languages in terms of you know distributions and frequencies of part of speech.

177
00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:03.420
Christof Sch?ch: This is a bit less of a problem for the named entities, because the inventory of of texts, of course, much smaller, but here the main challenge is really that.

178
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:13.140
Christof Sch?ch: literary texts are quite challenging in terms of named entity recognition anyways and then to do this in multiple languages, at the same time is is a challenge.

179
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:20.040
Christof Sch?ch: identification of direct speech is an interesting one that I will talk about a little bit more, we have an analysis of the titles.

180
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:30.540
Christof Sch?ch: Of the novels that also has a specific strategy of of how to do this across languages, and then we have a study in progress on standard metric authorship retribution.

181
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.650
Christof Sch?ch: So just a few more words about identification of direct speech.

182
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:48.540
Christof Sch?ch: That sounds like a trivial trivial task, but it really isn't because the type of graphical conventions are very variable between the different languages.

183
00:31:49.110 --> 00:32:00.570
Christof Sch?ch: And also depend a lot on the time period on the printer so it's really not that easy to identify the direct speech parts of a novel.

184
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:15.360
Christof Sch?ch: reliably across but even within one language, but especially across languages, and so, in order to to make some progress with this challenge one a group from from among the action.

185
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:29.310
Christof Sch?ch: Used multilingual sentence embedding to do this so it's a instead of using now almost traditional word embedding they used sentence and weddings and.

186
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:41.640
Christof Sch?ch: multilingual version of those and managed to surpass the baseline performance, quite clearly, and so the the performance, the F1 score.

187
00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:51.630
Christof Sch?ch: For correctly recognizing direct speech was around 0.89 for all the different nine languages that were studied here.

188
00:32:52.170 --> 00:33:04.410
Christof Sch?ch: with very little variation I was actually surprised by that, so this is a pretty solid performance that we do hope to improve and we do hope to cover more languages, but this is very, very promising, in fact.

189
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:13.200
Christof Sch?ch: Second example is the title analysis, this is a forthcoming paper by another group of.

190
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:28.290
Christof Sch?ch: Authors from from among the cost action and what they did here is basically they took all the titles of all the novels in in attic and collaboratively so with people who.

191
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:42.750
Christof Sch?ch: Have a command of all the different languages and they annotated them with a schema annotation schema basically creates comparable language independent data so, for example, as we see in this example.

192
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:54.420
Christof Sch?ch: Is there a place that is mentioned in a title and if, yes, which one is there person that has mentioned If yes, what is the name, what is the status, what is the sex.

193
00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:12.600
Christof Sch?ch: Some formal characteristics, is it a two part title, what kind of separation character, do we find is there a genre indicator and which one etc, and you know some more some more information about the titles, so that they become.

194
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:19.230
Christof Sch?ch: That they take this becomes available for analysis across all the languages.

195
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:35.250
Christof Sch?ch: And, of course, this is combined with the metadata that we have from the from the corporate on each novel and just as one example of what what you can do with this is, for example, simply look at the number of words in each title in different time periods and.

196
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:46.110
Christof Sch?ch: yeah it was interesting for me to see that actually a lot of the titles are quite short so 234 words is the dominant title length.

197
00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:48.990
Christof Sch?ch: And this is true.

198
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:58.080
Christof Sch?ch: for all time periods, but there's also a considerable number of pretty long titles so 10 to 22 words.

199
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:18.900
Christof Sch?ch: So they are yeah 40 titles that we found that are really quite long and there are lots you know many other results that that this type of study comprises, but this is just an example of how you go beyond the individual languages basically by by.

200
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:25.110
Christof Sch?ch: Moving on to a level that is language, independent and joining your data on that on that level.

201
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:36.240
Christof Sch?ch: Now the final example of usage scenarios cemeteries are standard metric authorship attribution here, we have just two examples to dental grams that show.

202
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:44.070
Christof Sch?ch: The similarity of texts to each other and the clustering and what you can see here is so on the left, we have the French.

203
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:55.980
Christof Sch?ch: The French corpus, and so this is the part of the corpus that that consists of three novels per author so it's just a subset of its of each corpus.

204
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:07.710
Christof Sch?ch: But what you see here is that the French for the French corpus our current standard methods baseline work perfectly so each cluster is a perfect set of three authors.

205
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:20.070
Christof Sch?ch: Whereas for the Romanian and i'm sorry to be using Romanian as the as the challenging language here again, the Romanian collection is.

206
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:31.200
Christof Sch?ch: A lot more tricky for the algorithm so we do have some clean nice author clusters, but we do have a lot of diverging clusters as well here's a UNESCO.

207
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:41.160
Christof Sch?ch: That is, you know, together with this other author, we have one single one up here that isn't with the others, you know lots of little problems and.

208
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:54.300
Christof Sch?ch: We can obviously compare this also with a look at this in a different way in a slightly more evaluative way, we can look at the performance.

209
00:36:54.870 --> 00:37:08.400
Christof Sch?ch: of different algorithms at different parameters for different languages and we see let's pick the French one again, so the French one you see with this algorithm as data.

210
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.700
Christof Sch?ch: is pretty much perfect.

211
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:20.550
Christof Sch?ch: Starting starting around here with 350 words and it just stays there, so it works really well.

212
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:36.120
Christof Sch?ch: Whereas for the Romanian one if we pick out that one again it kind of plateaus at 0.7 70% accuracy, for all of the algorithms all the parameters that we tried and now the interesting questions, of course, why is that the case.

213
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:42.270
Christof Sch?ch: It could be that the Romanian corpus, in itself, is just much more difficult.

214
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:59.730
Christof Sch?ch: I suspect, for example, that the generic variety at the moment is less pronounced in the Romanian corpus meaning than in the French corpus, meaning that a lot more novels are similar in terms of genre and themes.

215
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:15.630
Christof Sch?ch: and would therefore be more difficult to tell apart for the organism, whereas the French corpus is really very diverse and even those office with with three novels are quite you know distinct so it might be an easier corpus, but it might also be that.

216
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:27.990
Christof Sch?ch: The algorithms that we have used up to now for English in 80% of the cases and then for German and French sometimes that they are just optimized or happened to work particularly well.

217
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:44.670
Christof Sch?ch: With languages other than Romanian and we really need to do more research to find to find out but it's a typical situation, so you really need a large Cobra to make these tests, more reliable than just this little set of 30 novels.

218
00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:55.740
Christof Sch?ch: engineered to try a lot of different parameters and algorithms to really find out what's going on, and especially also, of course, look at the composition of the corporate that go into it.

219
00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:06.180
Christof Sch?ch: And with that, I would like to conclude, very briefly, my initial question was what is l tech, and of course the key the obvious.

220
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:15.900
Christof Sch?ch: Answer it's a multilingual resource and that's why I centered this talk around not liberalism, but it's a lot more as well, I think it's really a learning opportunity.

221
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:24.720
Christof Sch?ch: For collaborative research because of corporates like that you can do on your own because you need knowledge of all those different literary traditions.

222
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:37.710
Christof Sch?ch: All the different you know taggers and language models so it has to be such a European endeavor, and so the Cross section has has been a perfect match, I think, for this kind of research.

223
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:49.890
Christof Sch?ch: I hope that LTE is becoming a rallying point for a European multilingual community of people interested in digital approaches approaches to literary history.
