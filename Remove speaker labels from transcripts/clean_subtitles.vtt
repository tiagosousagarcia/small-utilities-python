00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.870
hi everyone and welcome to our latest at new virtual visiting speaker.

2
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:22.140
This week we have well this week, this month we have Dr Laura Estill i'm Dr Laura Estill is an associate professor of English at St Francis Xavier University in Canada.

3
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:41.970
And holds a prestigious tier to Canada research chair and digital humanities Recent publications that at least I remember include dramatic extracts in the 17th century English manuscripts as well as an edited collection of early British drama in manuscript which cannot.

4
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.550
I think.

5
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.700
she's previously a Co editor of the.

6
00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:03.300
World shake for bibliography she's also co editor of early modern digital review and decks a database of dramatic extracts and today she's going to be talking to us about using digital resources in the Shakespeare class for crystal.

7
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:14.790
Thank you, Dr Cummings and thank you for that kind introduction and everyone for joining us today and what I know is a busy time of term and an odd time of our lives.

8
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:26.790
i'm currently speaking to you from mcgee mcgee, which is the ancestral and unseated territory of the mid market people in Nova Scotia Canada, but my story doesn't actually start in Nova Scotia.

9
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:37.080
My story starts when I was an undergraduate in Ontario I had a research assistantship for Professor Carol Davison who was working on a book on Gothic literature's.

10
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:47.940
My job was to go to the basement of the lady library at the University of Windsor Canada and scroll through microfilm to take copies of reviews of Gothic novels.

11
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.720
Nowadays, however, that research assistantship would have been entirely different these reviews are available and tons of digital resources.

12
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.540
For many humanists instead of learning to read microfilm and facsimiles using a microfilm machine or going into archives and work with archival materials.

13
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.490
Our research practices have evolved and now what we do is we find digital facsimiles using online platforms.

14
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:25.920
i'm a literary scholar who turned to digital humanities, because I could see how it was changing the way we access and create knowledge about Shakespeare early modern drama and book history.

15
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:37.800
My examples today are taken from English department classes, but some of the principles would hold true for other courses, even if the area of study isn't the same even if you're not teaching a Shakespeare class.

16
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:50.640
Some of these principles will will hold true i'd like to thank my students for embarking on these explorations with me and I just wanted to let you know that any student that I name or quote, I have asked permission in advance.

17
00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:01.620
My talk today is from a forthcoming chapter in an edited collection called digital pedagogy in early modern studies edited by Andy Silva and Scott show field.

18
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.090
Okay.

19
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:15.360
There are a number of ways to incorporate the digital, which is an often a morpheus category admittedly into teaching Shakespeare at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

20
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.420
Indeed, most Shakespeare classes already include digital components, even if it's research taken with undertaken with early English books online.

21
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.030
EVO or the world Shakespeare bibliography.

22
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:41.070
If an instructor plans, an entirely analog course the students will still turn to websites with varying degrees of credibility from add written spark notes, and this is the spark notes to stats on their usage with high school students.

23
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:50.160
To the well respected Internet Shakespeare additions instructors wanting to bring digital elements into their classroom can collaborate on exciting assignments for existing projects.

24
00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:00.960
For instance, you could have students right Wikipedia entries professors can join the map of early modern London pedagogical partnership, they could transcribe EVO text learning using type rate.

25
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.080
Large digital projects like global shakespeare's at MIT often include students as learning partners.

26
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:16.620
Students could be encouraged to blog in a Shakespeare class as Peter kerwin has written about or use social media creatively as kyle de Roberto has written about.

27
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:33.300
tech savvy instructors can even have students build an entire project or contribute to a project as a class today, however, rather than talking about building or contributing to a digital project i'm talking about equipping students to use digital projects.

28
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.670
and facilitating their use and understanding of these resources.

29
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:52.410
So often, when a digital humanities component is included in the course the question becomes what are you going to cut to fit in the digital, but the question I like to ask is, are we teaching current research practice if we exclude the digital.

30
00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:03.990
Although sometimes heralded as a brave new world digital Shakespeare studies is not a new field as the stock image of Shakespeare confused by technology shows.

31
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.560
he's been confused by computers for centuries now i'm just kidding.

32
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.880
The landscape of digital Shakespeare studies is however ever is, however, always changing.

33
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:24.630
new digital projects appear existing websites vanish and even those resources that have stood the test of time are updated with new materials and functionality.

34
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:34.380
My talk today outlines a mid term assignment that can be used as part of a broader course, it can be the only digital component in humanities course with other focuses.

35
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.810
If, in your course students are contributing to a larger digital project this smaller assignment can be helped prepare them to.

36
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:51.810
Consider how they're making a valuable contribution to the existing field if they're writing a final paper and i'll use some of my examples from final papers.

37
00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.990
This assignment is offer scaffolding to help show them the range of approaches to the field of study and can prompt them to undertake original research.

38
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:09.390
Even students who are not interested in pursuing Shakespeare studies which I can't imagine why that would be, but some of them don't want to.

39
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:21.690
they'll find these the study of digital resources valuable because evaluating and analyzing online tools and projects is an eminently transferable skill.

40
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.330
So here we go.

41
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.580
And although i'm going to be talking about Shakespeare, we can think about other examples here to.

42
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:41.610
The basics of the digital project analysis assignment are simple each student in the class researches an existing online site and shares their findings with the rest of the class.

43
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:48.570
And i'll go over some of the logistics of how we undertake it and i'll share some of my assignment prompts with you as well.

44
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:58.590
Having students teach each other has multiple benefits they gain mastery over one digital project and they're exposed to a range of projects.

45
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:14.340
The benefits of learning by teaching sometimes called ldl learning do 11 for subject mastery and communication skills have been touted for centuries, and most recently lauded as a preparation for life in information and knowledge societies.

46
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:30.150
In my experience, also students often work harder to impress their peers than to just impress me and rather than listen to me drone on about digital sites and how to use them, they hear firsthand from other students what the benefits are drawbacks might be.

47
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:38.130
Now, the first step into Korean creating an assignment like this is, of course, to figure out which sites should we send our students to.

48
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:45.840
Thankfully there are already tons of curated list on almost any research topic you're interested in.

49
00:07:46.530 --> 00:08:01.950
Specifically, the study of Shakespeare has lots so one of these images the top one is from Clare burns of pill crows list, which is a very comprehensive list about digital resources sorted by category I also have.

50
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:12.780
A link or a screenshot here of Sarah warner's digitize first folio which is just a list of all the different ways, you can access different copies of the first folio.

51
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:23.760
there's also lists by Adam G hooks and cyrus already if you're not a Shakespearean in your field i'm sure you already know a number of resources that could be studied and there are tons of other lists to turn to.

52
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:32.850
If you do an advanced search of the world Shakespeare bibliography by and you limit your sources to digital projects as your document type.

53
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:49.650
i've sorted the results reverse chronologically here and we can see there's 220 digital projects solely devoted to the study of Shakespeare the world Shakespeare bibliography wouldn't, for instance, include lots of relevant digital resources like.

54
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.760
It wouldn't include the.

55
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:04.200
hens low Allen archive because it's not specifically focused on Shakespeare, but that might be one that would be interesting to approach in this class.

56
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:15.780
The digital projects that you talk about can be tailored to a particular theme like Shakespeare and performance Shakespeare instruction textual studies Shakespeare in book history or global Shakespeare.

57
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:27.300
Some existing sites and some even some printed resources offer curated list, with particular emphasis like Hugh mcrae richmond's chapter on teaching the history plays using digital resources.

58
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:34.890
The Arden early modern drama guides critical reader series also offer targeted suggestions that include.

59
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:46.830
Digital content so Jillian woods and Laura seymour have a chapter on learning and teaching resources on Henry the fifth that would be applicable if you wanted to focus your attention on just one play.

60
00:09:47.850 --> 00:10:00.270
The main difference when I assign this project for an undergrad class or a graduate class is the kinds of digital resources, I offer students to consider and the sophistication I expect in their analyses.

61
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:14.070
Here is a list that I took from other people's lists to think about what would be valuable for my students to talk about last term, it was an upper division undergrad course and, as you can see, this is not the whole list.

62
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:26.250
shakespeare's Canada city has led to the development of many digital projects focused on Shakespeare, but there's a value in moving beyond Shakespeare, and looking at the resources to put his work in context.

63
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.190
Exploring digital projects beyond those focused on Shakespeare can help students see.

64
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:40.590
shakespeare's work in relation to his contemporaries and can help them ask questions about Shakespeare central place in our classrooms and theaters.

65
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:53.670
If you want, you can even use this assignment instead of saying we can say here's a Shakespeare class we're actually going to focus on all non Shakespeare related resources right.

66
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:05.580
Like the companion of Renaissance drama is a very web one point O resource, I have on this list the digital anthology of early modern English brahma from the folger, for instance.

67
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:18.330
Students can get very excited about, for instance, the last plays database which among its hundreds of descriptions of last plays includes nine entries on Shakespearean plays and apocrypha.

68
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:25.890
because it shows just how much evidence we are missing and can help us better qualify the claims, we make about early modern drama.

69
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:35.670
She Alexander, who is a graduate student who her area of focus is book history and Victorian studies astutely observed in her presentation that.

70
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:43.890
The last place database effectively argues that scholars knowledge of early modern drama remains limited with much content yet to be discovered.

71
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:58.170
By extension, this website also argues that the early modern drama cannon needs to be expanded, and so it provides early modernists a well articulated computer supportive collaborative workspace in which to share and build upon that work.

72
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:11.880
This assignment can lead students to question indeed why so many projects have a focus that starts and ends with Shakespeare and can be an effective way to introduce contextual materials into a single author course.

73
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:22.590
Both undergraduate and graduate students benefit from this when I teach this to undergrads I like to put on some resources focused on pedagogy.

74
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:29.340
For instance, if people are working to certify as teachers, the resources that will be interested interested them will be different.

75
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.140
If they're planning on teaching in high schools or primary schools this past semester my students looked at.

76
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:51.870
The rsc Shakespeare learning zone and also australia's Shakespeare reloaded and during the class discussion time they talked about how these sites were different and complimentary and why you might turn to one versus another.

77
00:12:52.890 --> 00:13:07.050
The content of these sites, I mean they're both aimed at a similar audience with different geographic locations, but how many if you were a teacher Where would you go to find your resources to teach Shakespeare.

78
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:17.310
At the graduate level, I often ask students to work with more advanced research, such as that facilitated by the database of early English playbooks.

79
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:24.930
And online sites by the records of early English drama, like the patrons and performances site or early modern London theaters and last.

80
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:43.440
One memorable semester read launched its new website, the week, one of my students was supposed to present on it, she handled the situation with aplomb and help lead the class in a discussion of what had been changed and how it had changed and also thinking starting to think about why.

81
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:52.920
I mean, there was a moment that she came to see me in my office hours with just panic and what actually came out of it was one of the best discussions we had all term.

82
00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:03.360
The myth of the digital native a generation of learners who innately understands computers has been thoroughly debunked.

83
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:22.830
Students need to learn how to use digital projects to make thoughtful arguments, this can include learning basic skills such as determining the scope of a project and how to search it why, for instance, is the launching of the Mary not included in deep it's a play from 1632.

84
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:36.000
So when we offer, so I like to offer some test cases to students and we do some of this in class I also offer students when they're working on their presentations I give them some suggestions on what to look for.

85
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:53.850
And what happens is students start to realize that a database of early English playbooks, which is a focus on print is not the same as a database of early English plays also something that they come to from the last place database, the launching of the Mary is a manuscript play.

86
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.920
manuscript play is naturally outside the scope of deep.

87
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:10.680
And here's another one why, when you search for Macbeth in early English books online, this is the you can see here the search terms as title Macbeth.

88
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:19.290
i've sorted this by the oldest first, and if you just looked at this at a glance you would be like okay great Macbeth was first published in 1673.

89
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:35.490
What to a season Shakespearean, it is obvious that Macbeth was first published in the 1623 first folio but the title of the first folio is comedies histories and tragedies it emits the name of the Scottish play.

90
00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:45.510
But for students, this is a learning experience they can learn about the folio they can learn about anthology ization they can even learn about William dominance restoration adaptations and so on.

91
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:57.120
Furthermore, grappling with unexpected search results help students discover best practices for searching digital sites and help them determine the scope and where let's say the.

92
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:11.370
The fuzziness is to use a term that EVO itself uses as Ian gad has pointed out, searching EVO can seem like a search of all early modern literature, when this is patently not the case.

93
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:19.890
Each digital site is bound by its editorial decisions and practices, why are the English short title catalogs.

94
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:32.550
Different results than EVO, why does it offer different results than deep, how do these projects diverge and overlap, if you want to undertake research in the early modern period, these are the kinds of questions you have to grapple with.

95
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:43.560
What material, and this is an example, I also had from last semester what material is covered in the J store understanding series Shakespeare collection.

96
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:51.540
It was formerly called understanding Shakespeare, which seems a bit catch here and what is the most useful way to navigate its results.

97
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:59.370
I don't know if you've ever been to this website or not, but it offers the folger digital texts or which is now called the folger Shakespeare.

98
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.980
It offers the folger Shakespeare text to the place and then it shows you how many.

99
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:15.360
articles in J store quote that line so here, you can see, to be or not to be as quoted in 500 and to Jay store articles, but as my student pointed out last term.

100
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:26.340
That is a little bit misleading because it's not 502 articles about Hamlet and Jay store it's 502 articles, who, at some point throughout it to be or not to be without.

101
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.820
Without actually sometimes even going was not even sometimes being about Shakespeare.

102
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:41.340
I find this so this tells us about you mean you could point to this and make a claim about the popularity of given lines and Shakespeare.

103
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:52.290
But you have to think about this is limited and Jay store so it's not a record of all scholarship you have to think about how lots of people quote Shakespeare when they're not actually talking about Shakespeare.

104
00:17:52.590 --> 00:18:04.560
You have to know how to make a claim that makes sense I love this image and I love this example of to be or not to be being a super popular line but it's not about to be or not to be being.

105
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:12.480
The most critically analyzed line in a store right that there's a difference there and the claims, we can make.

106
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:30.240
I find this assignment having students go research or digital project come back and teach the class about it helps me because it teaches me about the assumptions I make interfaces that i'm used to are called database or called dated by students.

107
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:38.460
It also helps me learn about how they approach things because we're not going to have the same assumptions when we approach a project.

108
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:57.030
By learning how to use digital sites, they can also create original and impressive research, one of my undergraduate students Madeline lowery was fascinated by the images of Victorian and Edwardian Shakespeare actors, presented by Shakespeare, and the players, this is a website from emory.

109
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:09.450
This resource is an digital archive of images of postcards of actors who performed Shakespeare at the turn of the century from 1880 to 1914.

110
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:21.750
In her final paper lowery wrote about how desdemona was portrayed in these early performances captured on postcards and argued that in some productions desdemona was presented as a new woman.

111
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:32.730
That turn of the century feminist aesthetic reflected a whole new way of thinking about women's role in society and what women could and should do, for instance, like writing.

112
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:46.800
lowery focused on a 1907 production stage in Manchester featuring Margaret helston as desdemona and Matheson Lang as a fellow she brought in this iconic image of the gibson girl as the aesthetic for comparison.

113
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:58.770
I was so impressed to hear to read her paper, where she had gone found this research from these resources by herself and come up with a wholly original thesis.

114
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:07.260
This website allowed an undergraduate student to undertake original research that would not have been popular would not have been possible.

115
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:16.200
Without costly travel access to archives depending on where you are, you might be fortunate to be able to access all sorts of archives, but.

116
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:28.410
Your research questions and your areas of interest might might or might not also be possible, there might hypothetically also be a global pandemic gone or something like that that prohibits you from traveling and things like that.

117
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:42.000
So this research that would have been too costly and time consuming for an undergraduate to undertake in person, by going to visit postcards and thinking about that was made much simpler, with a digital archive.

118
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:53.220
And I will also say that we have to think about our expectations in in Canada most undergraduate students are taking five classes, at a time for a full course load.

119
00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:02.520
We couldn't reasonably expect someone to go to an archive and spend their time there for a final paper for one 200 level undergrad class.

120
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:11.970
The other thing I will add is that this kind of assignment or offering students these tools makes it harder to plagiarize if they are there's a ton of.

121
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:24.180
Shakespeare essays of varying quality, as you know, on the Internet, but there's not a lot of essays that go to a digital resource find something interesting in there and write about it and make it an argument based on that.

122
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:35.100
Even when students who undertake this digital project analysis choose not to use the digital project in their final paper.

123
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:44.910
The skills gained in this assignment offer them a better way of understanding shakespeare's play shakespeare's plays or poems, although I don't usually focus on the poems.

124
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:57.180
Creating thoughtful evaluations is a vital skill in the humanities learning to assess a digital projects audience credibility usability and scope is an important part of critical thinking.

125
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:11.130
Every digital project is itself an argument and we have to figure out what arguments those projects make they make arguments by having certain things included other things excluded certain things centralized others.

126
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:20.220
marginalized this assignment also show students, how we make arguments as Shakespearean we look at.

127
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.590
primary sources, like those featured on Shakespeare documented by the folger Shakespeare library.

128
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:36.240
We look at performance translation and reception history, often in national contexts, like the Taiwan Shakespeare database and Shakespeare and espana tell us.

129
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:47.850
We think we count things and we quantify using, for instance, the concordance is of shakespeare's Open Source Shakespeare or going to sites like shakespeare's words.

130
00:22:48.600 --> 00:23:05.490
And that's just to name a few approaches these sites exist because scholars wanted to promote a particular way of thinking about Shakespeare and what's useful is to help students step back a second and say what is the underlying argument of these sites.

131
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:26.160
In preparing these presentations they gain a depth of understanding about a given area of Shakespeare studies, but they also are exposed to a breadth of knowledge, because they hear all of the other students talk and and we actually as you'll see create some shared resources to.

132
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.590
build on our final papers for.

133
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:47.640
there's no single approach to Shakespeare studies on the web, just as not digitally even a full semester course on just Shakespeare in the digital would not be able to cover all of the scholarly and valuable digital resources on Shakespeare.

134
00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:57.720
This assignment builds on students contagious enthusiasm and helps them and, like I said they would get bored if they just listened to me and.

135
00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:10.500
They hear each other and my favorite is when they take an assignment, or they take a project that someone else wrote about for their and talked about in their presentation and they use that one for their final paper.

136
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:16.860
it's not that they said Oh, I wrote about Shakespeare documented and so i'm going to do my final paper using Shakespeare documented.

137
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:29.460
They say Oh, I heard someone else give a presentation about the Taiwan Shakespeare database and i'm going to incorporate that into my final paper into my argument about and this happened last term King Lear.

138
00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:47.430
Now, how do you actually go about making this assignment work there's a couple of different ways to do this and i've done this in and I mentioned undergrad and Grad classes, which I believe you would call postgraduate classes, I have also done this.

139
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:56.790
In different class sizes so and this year for the first time I did it teaching online and not teaching in person.

140
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:07.110
For a small class I like to have students each prepare a presentation, where they walk us through the site and show the kind of research that site can facilitate identifying the sites argument.

141
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:15.030
i've had success with either devoting to class periods to these discussions so like a full week about in the middle of term.

142
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:28.470
or sometimes having students present one at the beginning of each class the nice thing about having them present in a whole chunk is that I always a lot a ton of time for discussion, because that is one of the most valuable.

143
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:36.270
Times where my students are asking each other questions and I give them grades for asking each other questions.

144
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:46.530
If i'm teaching a large class, and by that I mean like 60 or more people the way I do it is instead of offering everyone to choose their own presentation.

145
00:25:46.920 --> 00:26:00.780
I assign them each a project, and I would have let's say six projects so everyone in group one talks about the Shakespeare in the players, everyone in group to talks about the Taiwan Shakespeare database, for instance.

146
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:12.450
And they all learn about that, and then they come into class and they present in small groups, I have not yet done that one in an online course, but you could do it using breakout rooms.

147
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.200
In, whatever your digital platform is for teaching.

148
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:22.650
And I would like to thank Madame de puter my high school geography teacher for teaching me that technique.

149
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.310
When we.

150
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:45.690
When we this is this is part of the assignment prompt as well, so when I asked the students to think about the sites, I asked him to think about who writes and creates it is it still updated, what is it point is it scholarly, why is it useful, and I asked them to give examples.

151
00:26:49.590 --> 00:27:00.450
And I also offer some possible possibly relevant points for them to consider are there other sites that might compete with this site, this is the thing asking students to.

152
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:11.460
explore a digital project means that you have we as seasoned scholars can see a much larger piece of the field, this is trying to get them from.

153
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:27.990
newbie not to seeing the entire field, but just toward seeing more of the field and so when we have our discussions and they say things like oh i'm talking about mit's global Shakespeare How does that relate to the Taiwan Shakespeare database.

154
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.240
Or, as I mentioned, last time talking about the Shakespeare learning zone and Shakespeare reloaded.

155
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:41.520
I also talked about right, we also have them talk about things like interface, and if the site makes sense to them because.

156
00:27:42.330 --> 00:28:00.480
Some things that we think will make sense to a student right away just don't students who are came up with the blank Google search bar for instance don't understand boolean operators so always have a library and come to your class to help with research, how to research days as well.

157
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:15.510
And I give them a sample thesis and you can see here, this is the discussion, I asked them, I give them grades for asking other people questions.

158
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:27.780
So here's my sample thesis that I gave them the Internet Shakespeare additions argues that scholars want to be able to compare early printings of shakespeare's works consult facsimiles and use both edited and annotated modern additions.

159
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:37.200
The IOC is functionality offers exciting possibilities for researchers working on Shakespeare its scope, reinforces Shakespeare central place in the English literary canon.

160
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.800
And when the students go through sort of thinking about here's the things I like about a site here's the things I don't like about a site.

161
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:57.240
They have to think about what the criteria they set up for success are as well it's a simple rhetorical evaluation assignment that lots of people do in their English classes and have done forever we're just applying those ideas to digital.

162
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:09.870
For undergrads I also like to link this to the craft test not sure you've ever heard of that one currency relevance authority cr a P, and so you say.

163
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:15.270
let's find out what this site is about I usually give students.

164
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:31.230
Sorry we'll talk with the handout i'll come back to the setup again so when I have students present they have to give us a handout sometimes last time I had them do PowerPoint slides because we were teaching, we were at a distance.

165
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:47.790
But often I just have them add a page to the course website and then they walk up to the class and they share their page on the course website and walk us through the key things, including a link to the site and screenshots and from that handout I take their annotation which is.

166
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:58.710
A bibliographic citation and, like the key points and I make an annotated bibliography and I hand it back to all the students and then the students can say.

167
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:09.420
Oh so and so was talking about this site that was really cool but I forgotten what it is, where should I go thinking thinking about that for my final paper and they've got a reference that we've created together.

168
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.610
And I also like them to have at least some images on their online handouts.

169
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:32.550
What I find challenging about this assignment, is that the students actually really want to talk for a long time about their projects, as with any presentations here at the challenge has not been to get them to talk long enough, the challenge has been to rein them in, so I do the.

170
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:46.770
Say okay your handout if it's when it was printed I said one page when we were doing slides I said no more than four slides I just try to keep them on top on topic.

171
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:54.510
And we also at the end of my annotated bibliography I always include a glossary where students have explained things like.

172
00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:08.010
textual studies that's a word we throw around all the time, your undergrads have never heard of it, or maybe not until they came to your class and I always find it fascinating the words that students pick and they say oh.

173
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:15.720
i've learned what a concordance was going to this website and then the rest of the class will benefit from that as well.

174
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:32.880
This year, for the first time I also pointed students to early modern digital review, which is an existing reviews journal as James mentioned i'm one of the co editors, and this is published with Renaissance and Reformation on a soundstage a phone.

175
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:43.710
Established Journal and we publish reviews of digital projects, so this year I could say to students, here are some established reviews by scholars.

176
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:56.850
Thinking about how projects make meaning how they work, what works well with them is something that we have to continue doing, not just because projects change, but because our research questions change to.

177
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:08.070
When I teach this class I usually spend one session in advance going over an example project that is not a project that anyone will be.

178
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:20.970
writing about and talking about and we look at how we review different things if, by the way, you are interested in pitching a review or a digital project to be reviewed by em Dr let me know.

179
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.730
Okay.

180
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:31.710
As this talk has outlined, there are a number of important websites, to be used in the teaching and research of Shakespeare.

181
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:44.130
it's equally important that educators and students are equipped to use these sites thinking critically about search results scholarly databases and digital projects might sound like a simple proposition.

182
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.450
But actually grappling with these ideas is in no way easy.

183
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:56.820
It often means that I have to show students students will ask me questions, why does this not work on a website how Why is why is the search result coming up.

184
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:06.690
And it will not be easily apparent to me, sometimes right, and so I have to say, well let's go look at the about page let's go figure this out together and we have, I have to model to them.

185
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:16.650
That learning how to learn is about not knowing things and more knowing where to find information, sometimes right it's about.

186
00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:29.760
You don't have to have all the knowledge you just have to start knowing where to get the knowledge and although the majority of our students will not continue with careers as Shakespearean or humanities researchers, the kinds of.

187
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:42.150
Preparation that ask them to become better critical thinkers and encouraging them to ask well framed questions of digital resources is actually going to help them well beyond their classroom.

188
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:43.800
Thank you.

189
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.870
Thanks Laura um since everyone's muted Oh, give me some Applause

190
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.150
And also that reminds me I should stop the recording.
