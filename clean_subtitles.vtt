00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:15.719
hi everyone and welcome to another in our series of new animating texts Newcastle university series of virtual visiting speakers.

2
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.540
This week, this week, this month even we have.

3
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.910
My testimony who comes to us from the Department of mixture at the University of Antwerp.

4
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.550
And where he's an assistant Professor there, and he does lots of courses on corporate computational linguistics.

5
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.340
All sorts of things of programming for the vanity of the default philology and that kind of stuff and what i'd like is in one of his bio somewhere on the web, he says.

6
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:59.580
I code in Python tweet in English and live in Brussels, which I thought was a good way of saying tonight he's going to be talking talking to us about estimating the loss of medieval literature, with the methods from ecology Mike.

7
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.440
Leaving.

8
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.130
Everyone.

9
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.020
sharing my screen Now let me know if that wouldn't work.

10
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.440
Here we go.

11
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.920
So, welcome to the stock on estimating the loss of medieval literature indeed with methods from ecology and.

12
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.480
What we will focus on today is historic, literature and, more specifically, historic literature that did not survive from the Middle Ages.

13
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.200
And from a broader perspective, what what i'd like to do with this papers is challenge the big divide that still exists between one hand biology and the other.

14
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.500
On the other hand, culture and I believe that precisely and the use of digital methods of computational methods allows us to to bridge that gap.

15
00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.090
And today, our report on on joint work with a large number of people whom Allah mentioned downstream in the talk.

16
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.880
But, especially with for with getting up was the senior researcher from the makers institutes in Amsterdam.

17
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:19.770
And it's with him that i've been working on these problems for for a while now we've also presented this work, a couple of times already, but each time we make a little progress and i'm happy to share with you, where we stand today.

18
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:33.060
Now first about this curious mix today this mix of literature and ecology, so I assume that some of you will already have a vague idea of which kind of things are studied in ecology.

19
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.330
But just to set the stage I included definition here on this slide that I grabbed from a statistical textbook on ecology by katie and show.

20
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.950
That I read a while back and this definition goes like this it says that ecology is concerned with the number or the abundance, as they call it in ecology of living things.

21
00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:08.490
So how many individuals, there are, how their numbers evolve over time, where they are where they go and important questions in ecology concerned their interactions with the a biotic and biotic environment, but also interaction.

22
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.550
Between these individuals between these living things what mechanisms drive the numbers that we see and their dynamics.

23
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:32.280
And while for her, and I have been trying to do in the past two years or so, is exploring whether we can make the following drop in replacement when it comes to to literary studies and, more specifically medieval literary studies.

24
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:42.810
So, how does this sound medieval literary studies is concerned with the number of literary works, the abundance of literary works, how many manuscripts there are.

25
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.630
And how their numbers have evolved over time, where they were where they went to an important.

26
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:58.530
Questions they're concerned their interactions interactions between texts with the environment, but also interactions between texts intersexuality etc.

27
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:10.590
And I think that this replacement pretty much sums up our current research program, so we are trying to find out how meaningful, it is to take ecological methodologies.

28
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.860
and applied them to medieval texts as if they were living organisms that are part themselves of a larger ecosystem of medieval literature.

29
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:31.230
So this has been very rewarding for us so far it's an experience and one crucial insight that we obtained is related to the following again citing from that.

30
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.950
katie and sharp textbook and relates to the fact that he colleges increasingly acknowledge.

31
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:48.090
that their work involves a two tiered process So what does that mean it means that there's an actual ecological state s in the world can see that evolve over time.

32
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:58.170
But as researchers, we never get to properly observed that, because our our observation is are the o's in in the illustration is imperfect so.

33
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:07.080
there's the actual number of polar bears on the North Pole, so to speak, but then there's also the number of polar bears, that you somehow got to observe.

34
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:18.900
Which is something completely different, of course, and much of what statisticians doing in ecology is directed in fact correcting their own observations which they never really trust.

35
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:31.380
And we found it very inspiring that they make such a principal distinction between these true ecological mechanism mechanisms and then, on the other hand, the observational mechanisms in their work.

36
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.820
And if you will fully fully acknowledge and embrace that distinction.

37
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:51.660
The way in which you practice your your science in fact changes radically, and this might sound a bit abstract at this stage in the talk, I hope that by the end of the presentation you'll understand better why this is such a an interesting distinction to make.

38
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.480
And this is where the the actual talk starts i'm going to go back to that image that you saw on our opening slide.

39
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:10.020
which was put there on purpose, of course, and this is a PG county jeannie it's a medieval village in Tuscany Italy.

40
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.860
And nowadays it is permanently submerged under water because of the construction of a large Dan in the neighborhood.

41
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:30.300
When the lake is temporarily drink, you can sometimes catch a glimpse of the village, but normally you can only see a couple of towers some roofs like you see in this picture it's a kind of a modern Atlantis you could see.

42
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:43.470
And this village is an excellent metaphor for the main problem that we are talking about today, and that is the pretty simple fact is the fact that the study of the history of human culture.

43
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:52.050
is hindered seriously hindered by the fact that we have lost a great deal of material artifacts over the centuries.

44
00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:02.790
I think that this is something that is true across many areas in the humanities and it's especially true for pre modern literature medieval literature, which is my main focus here today.

45
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:13.410
Basically, we have lost many, many books over the centuries and be accidentally due to bombings or fires in the 20th century.

46
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:24.540
Sometimes also intentionally because historical collectors would often have disposed of duplicates, for instance, which is a bit weird for from our perspective, but that that often happened.

47
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:45.330
And this explains our use of the image of Atlantis so when you work with historical literature, you can only work with this very incomplete probably highly biased sample that is only a small part of the original population, so to speak, of historic literature that once existed.

48
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:55.830
So I think striking how narratives of robots have become ubiquitous in recent mainstream culture.

49
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:05.010
To the left here i'm showing the trailer of that recently launched documentary on netflix by Sir David attenborough a life on our planet.

50
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:19.290
And that whole movie result revolves around the dramatic loss in in biodiversity that our planet is currently experiencing so life as such doesn't seem to be diminishing diminishing for now.

51
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:30.690
But the diversity of life on Earth definitely is diminishing and a very similar argument is made in sapiens that's that the popular science book by you've all had a.

52
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:40.470
And, and also there the far reaching impact of human life on the planets ecological richness is a is a recurrent motive.

53
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:52.950
So, interestingly in our times, global ideologies of expansion and growth seem to be making room for new narratives that focus more on on loss and shrinkage.

54
00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:07.890
And our story today also revolves around this idea of loss, but then cultural loss, and I think that in this our endeavors is reminiscent of equal criticism, which is a branch of literary studies that you might have heard of.

55
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:23.100
So about the survival of medieval literature and going to review schematically some of the the route, some of the many rounds, by which medieval literature has been preserved or lost.

56
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.920
And, of course, this isn't specific to to middle Dutch Shell studies, which is the case that either i'll start with.

57
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:42.540
But to the left, you can see these little circles and these represent the distinct works that a medieval literature once comprised of what we know is that each work was copied into at least one document you could say.

58
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:51.300
But, of course, sometimes more copies were produced of a single work and in the simplest case like in the first row number one.

59
00:09:51.900 --> 00:10:06.210
And you see that a document could be copied into a single copy and then the copy would survive and then it would end up in a repository like a library an archive maybe private collection and so these are big Gray areas that you see to the right.

60
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:19.080
So manuscripts, however, have been completely destroyed in a fire or they have yet to reemerge because we we haven't found them yet maybe they haven't been properly catalog yet.

61
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:25.470
And if you look at the examples in row what is two and four, for instance.

62
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:37.260
And you will understand that these are cases of what we call last works, so why are these last works, all of the associated documents, all of the manuscripts in these works in which these words have been copied.

63
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.990
have been destroyed or they have not been recovered yet and the crucial message that you should take from from this slide from the schema.

64
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:59.490
Is that we make this pretty firm distinction between on the one hand, the Left column and abstract work and then the manuscripts or the sources in which these words have been a distance.

65
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:06.150
And these are the little book symbols that you see in the second column, but that distinction is very important.

66
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.680
Now, often all these beautiful manuscripts didn't survive and and skated fashion.

67
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:25.860
parchments, for instance, is a wonderfully solid material it ages really well and we see that, after the Middle Ages, the parchment from from older books was often recycled for different purposes.

68
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:36.690
that's, of course, very ecological thing to do, but it's it's insane to see what people have some things done to these books, the fragment to the left, for instance, was once used to.

69
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:49.620
strengthen our bishops mitre later times and it's so funny fact that this Bishop was actually walking around with some fairly erotic literature on his head by Maggie the false.

70
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.150
And so yeah, this is not very important it's just very interesting to see what happened to these books.

71
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:15.570
And now, today for illustration purposes i'm going to start with a small case study on middle Dutch literature, you probably don't know much about that, but that's Okay, this is the vernacular this Richard that has been written in the in the Low Countries during the medieval period.

72
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.670
And then, more specifically what we've done is we've looked at the so called hidden.

73
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:36.600
which would translate to English as chivalric Romans so chivalric epics and they contain the kind of narrative fiction, that is very typical of the Middle Ages, like, for instance, the legends of King Arthur and his nights.

74
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:51.270
So in this is middle Dutch corpus we currently know of 75 works in the genre and these works together survive in 167 documents typically yeah arch manuscripts.

75
00:12:52.260 --> 00:13:02.220
And he again, you see that this difference between an abstract work and then the material documents are copies in which that works your those words survive is pretty crucial.

76
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:10.680
Before the printing press, of course, all these copies of works for a hand copied, and this makes all of these books unique.

77
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:19.470
So we know for a fact that many of these middle Dutch manuscripts have been lost and as a consequence, also works.

78
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:32.250
And so what we don't know is how representative the corpus the surviving corpus is of the original full population that we had of middle Dutch Shiva read fiction.

79
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:49.950
and scholars have published some estimates, in the past experiences and influential this very history from 2006 that estimated that we must have had at least 100 works so in blinding of course at 25% of the works that we once had are not lost.

80
00:13:51.120 --> 00:14:07.740
And then, for the documents in which these works have been copied book historians have published estimates and, as you did only 7% of the manuscripts have survived and so these are interesting numbers because we will use these as a kind of baseline in our in our study.

81
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:18.900
And so, about this Ross from a scientific point of view there's a there's a pretty pressing issue with work here, and this issue of bias.

82
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:33.030
Because, as medievalists working on this corpus of middle Dutch manuscripts and texts we are strongly biased towards the stuff that actually survive, and that makes perfect sense, of course, because we, we have to work with what we have.

83
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:43.980
But the result of this bias is that we, in fact, are consistently under estimating how much there was in the first place, so what we are actually doing is under estimating.

84
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:54.990
The diversity of the number of documents, the number of works that were originally there and we must somehow account for that, I think.

85
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:09.330
So to answer that question how much has been really last of this middle Dutch literature and we have turned to the field of ecology and in these fields and equal diversity.

86
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:19.140
or species richness is a crucial concepts and for many reasons, ecologists often want to know how many distinct species live in a certain area.

87
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:29.550
Because that knowledge can, for instance, help them to monitor the impact of ecological disasters, you can think of the wildfires in Australia recently.

88
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:48.000
So, how does that work in practice well these ecologists, are going to send in a team of observers, who have to cover a certain area during a couple of weeks, months, maybe, maybe even years and you're going to use harmless straps or other trapping instruments.

89
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:55.500
And these people are literally going to start counting animals now of course they will have.

90
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.330
observed a lot of insects and smaller mammals so after a couple of days.

91
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:10.980
But they are in fact very likely to miss many species during their campaign so they are going to miss miss species that are more difficult to spot where animals on the.

92
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:29.670
tigers or snow leopards and that's, of course, a major issue, because these ecologist they know that our accounts are inaccurate so, in fact, like medievalists these ecologists know that they are under estimating the actual richness or the diversity of the species that live in that area.

93
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:41.760
Do account for these unseen species in a sample as they are called, ecology, has developed a tradition of statistical methods.

94
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:54.360
And here today i'm going to focus on one of these models, one of these unseen species models that is called child, one which has been developed by and chow was a diver nice biostatistician.

95
00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:02.700
So, if you would like to apply that method, you have to represent your data as so called abundance data remember abundance.

96
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:11.820
And in that data, you have to record how often each species has been cited during a campaign by registration campaign.

97
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:24.990
You can see an example of such a table here to the to the left, so in this example, what you see is that during some campaign some sampling effort 45 species were spotted that they were spotted only once.

98
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:35.580
And there was one species that has been observed, up to 17 times, this is not an a typical situation in ecology for this, I would call this data representative.

99
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:48.960
Now what is especially important in this data is what we call single terms and double teams So these are the number of species that have been cited exactly once or exactly twice.

100
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:58.680
And these are what they call F1 F2 in ecology, you can see them also in the formula for child one in the bottom left here.

101
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:08.430
And the main assumption of this method is that the number of low frequency species informs us as to how many species, we did not.

102
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:26.460
observe so, in fact, what we are doing Mathematically speaking is we take F1 F2 and we take those numbers to estimate F zero and zero is kind of a funny number it's the number of species that are out there, but which were observed exactly zero times.

103
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:39.300
And so, this isn't extremely relevant but it's kind of fun to know that this this method is chat one method is in fact directly, based on the code breaking work by Ellen during World War Two.

104
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:48.750
is related to what we know, or what we know as the the touring good estimates in information to you and touring and his college.

105
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:59.850
Colleagues, were also often confronted in situations in which they had to guess how likely it was that they would encounter an encrypted work in these enigma machines.

106
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:14.430
that they have not encountered so far so that's maybe unexpected, but this unseen species formula from chow one is directly, based on the formulas that were developed for a similar purpose at bletchley park.

107
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:25.590
Now the core question here is whether we could also take this method and apply it to our middle Dutch data to accounts for many evil works and.

108
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:35.220
We think that that is possible, obviously, but if you would like to believe that together with us you're going to have to accept the number of analogies.

109
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:43.020
So, first of all, what we are going to do is we are going to take works, and we are going to treat them as distinct species.

110
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:51.210
And then next what we are going to do is take the number of surviving documents for each works and we're going to see these as a proxy.

111
00:19:51.630 --> 00:20:01.110
For the number of sightings of an animal species in ecology and here to the assumption would be that the number of works that have a very low.

112
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:07.890
survival frequency can inform us as to the number of works that did not survive at all.

113
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:16.350
And you can even take this analogy, a little bit further and say that the the libraries or repositories in which these these manuscripts ended up.

114
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:27.180
are similar to like the traps that are used in ecology to catch animals, which is kind of a cool way of looking at this libraries as book traps, so to speak.

115
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:44.910
So, what happens if you do apply this method to, for instance, is middle Dutch data that we have well you get something like this, this is a graph that represents a circle species accumulation curve and this nicely sums up the result.

116
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:53.970
So you have that blue line and what we are doing with a blue line is we're plotting the number of works on the.

117
00:20:54.990 --> 00:21:07.200
Vertical axis as a function of the number of documents on the horizontal axis, so what this does is showing you how many new works you're likely to find.

118
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:21.210
As you sample or discover more documents you have a solid part to that line to the left and that's the situation as we can observe it nowadays, remember, we have 75 works that we know.

119
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:35.160
But what you also have is that dashed part of the line and that sort of offers a peek into the future, so it shows you what would happen if we were to continue finding more manuscripts even into infinity.

120
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.200
And this gorgeous asymptomatic So you can see it, it starts to flatten out at a given point and it's the saturation level.

121
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:52.260
So just that originally there were at least 152 decks, of which only half of them would survive nowadays.

122
00:21:53.130 --> 00:22:01.350
You also have that shaded light blue region and it gives you a what they call a confidence interval there's quite a bit of uncertainty, as you can see.

123
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:09.570
But this estimate still suggest that is very unlikely that only 25% of the works and is literature were lost.

124
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:19.650
So I think that, in a way, this model gives us grounds to reject the optimism in the field of middle Dutch studies and it allows us to.

125
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:30.270
put forward the hypothesis that at least half and probably more of the worst thing is literature, are now lost or they have at least not been recovered yet.

126
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:48.090
So some related research when it comes to previous work I think there's a big gap between on the one hand, the loss of works, the abstract thing and the loss of documents which are the concrete material artifacts.

127
00:22:49.290 --> 00:23:05.730
For the loss of works and specifically for the medieval period there's there has been very little empirical or quantitative previous work in fact only found a single paper so far on polyphonic manuscripts and cuthbert were similar methods are life.

128
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:25.080
In broader book history, we should definitely mentioned the pioneering work by imports, who applied a very similar model, but they applied it to to print it works early modern print it works and the formula that they use and relies on an estimation of the printer.

129
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:36.330
of books but that's, of course, a meaningless parameter in the case of medieval books, because they were handwritten and always produce this unique copies.

130
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:48.660
And regarding the loss of documents or the loss of manuscripts I think we're on firmer grounds and, in fact, there has been quite a bit of empirical statistical work.

131
00:23:49.560 --> 00:24:00.150
Most of this work, however, is based on medieval libraries, of which the historic composition is still known because their their catalogs survived.

132
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:13.950
And Okay, indeed, by by tracking how many of these documents still survive if you can identify those books, you can indeed estimate the loss of of documents that way.

133
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:21.570
But here there's two caveats and so, first of all, we don't have that many bookless from the Middle Ages.

134
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:27.810
And the second problem is that they often come from very protected privileged environments like like monasteries.

135
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:42.900
And for that reason we don't always know how representative these numbers are for other collection environments, so it would be really good if we could corroborate these numbers using clock complimentary methods and that's what we tried.

136
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:53.970
to remember john one is what we call an unseen species model, so we, in our analogy we argue that it can tell us something about the loss of many evil works.

137
00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:04.710
But equally relevant in medieval studies is this number of last documents so bluntly border how big was the original population of manuscripts the onset system.

138
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:17.280
for answering that question we use the extension of Charles method from 2009 that was originally mentoring informed field workers as to how they were doing on the registration campaign.

139
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:26.310
So suppose that we have been able to establish f0 right or the number of an observed species, the numbers that we missed when sampling.

140
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:36.510
And this model tries to estimate how many additional sightings we would have to do to observe each of these unseen species at least once.

141
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:49.380
And what we argue, is that this method can give us an idea of the number of lost manuscripts, especially because we can assume that most medieval works must have circulated in pretty low numbers anyways.

142
00:25:50.250 --> 00:26:00.420
And so, our reasoning here is that if you have seen every work at least once that probably implies that you also have seen most documents that you know most manuscripts.

143
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:14.070
So what is the second question that we're answering here how many more documents, how many more manuscripts what we have to discover from this genre in order to discover all works.

144
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:23.820
And so, in this graph you can see what happens if you apply this extension of ciao one to this middle Dutch data again.

145
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:38.130
So again, you see this species accumulation curve in blue and, basically, what we are trying to estimate here is the point where the blue dotted line starts to saturate right where D, as in dog kicks in.

146
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.350
And that green blob in the graph is showing you the distribution and for the estimates of the original number of documents and shown by the vertical line.

147
00:26:49.890 --> 00:27:03.420
And this method suggests that originally there were just over 2200 manuscripts containing middle duchy Valerie groans and of these only about 7.5% within survivor according to this method.

148
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:15.630
So, when does number first came out, I was really surprised and that had to do with the fact that we have these earlier instruments from from book historians in this domain, I mentioned them at the beginning of the talk.

149
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:32.040
And so scholars have previously suggested a survival factor of about 7% for knowledge non illustrated, for macular manuscripts on the Middle Ages, and that is the kind of book in which middle Dutch literature typically survives.

150
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:47.460
And I found it pretty astonishing that our method out of the blue, and although uses a completely different data source and gives us an estimate in roughly the same ballpark 7.5% according to our latest calculations.

151
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:56.760
So when it comes to manuscript survival, this method seems to corroborate previous findings by by book historians, which seems really valuable.

152
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:12.240
Now so far i've only been talking about this relatively small get a small scale case study of middle Dutch literature, which I really love.

153
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:20.250
But if we're being honest Dutch is only a smaller language also one of comparatively low prestige, you could say also in the Middle Ages.

154
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:36.690
So Dutch was nothing in comparison to French, for instance, which enjoyed a much higher prestigious international so that raises an obvious question these numbers that we obtained for middle Dutch what would they look for what they look like for other literature's.

155
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:48.930
And to answer that question we've set up an international group of domain experts and we these people, we are currently trying to obtain similar data sets for other medieval literature.

156
00:28:49.890 --> 00:29:01.890
And right now we are covering the following languages middle hi Jerome all Icelandic middle French or at least the longer Doyle middle English literature and Irish temperature.

157
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.730
So I should probably stress that that this last part of the talk only covers work in progress.

158
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:18.960
hasn't been properly reviewed and all that and we're still working very hard to on the Code and the materials and the numbers will shift a lot so.

159
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.680
I should really stress that this work hasn't been finalized in any way.

160
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:35.400
We are really working on this in the framework of open science and we are communicating about the project as it enrolls because we think that we can greatly benefit from from the feedback that we get along the way.

161
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:46.380
So that being said that huge disclaimer there's a number of interesting observations, I think that can be shared already if you're interested in following up on our work, you can check.

162
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:59.430
The Bible software package that we are currently developing called copia and this package makes it easy to apply these methods to your own data, and you can also track our progress there in the coming months.

163
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:10.440
And so the hardest part so far has been the delineation of the material because we started out from middle Dutch he did he Valerie epic chivalric Romans.

164
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:23.970
which I originally had a seem to be pretty unproblematic but it turned out to be surprisingly hard to find a good mapping of this text, for it to water cultural regions in medieval Europe.

165
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:37.590
So over all of our conversations with these experts we've been trying to negotiate a common definition of what we should include to arrive at a data sets that are at least somewhat comparable across medieval Europe.

166
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:52.470
So we are looking currently at what we call longer form chivalric and heroic narratives from the Middle Ages, so you could think of this as the equivalent of what we call action movies nowadays nowadays.

167
00:30:53.550 --> 00:31:03.870
And an indie six vernacular we are looking at all the works from the very start of these literature's up to the introduction of the printing press in these areas.

168
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:15.540
We include pros and verse six we don't make a distinction between original and translated material so in terms of contents and the material that we look at what includes.

169
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:27.990
Like the vanilla chivalric romances of the arthurian type, but it would also include indigenous heroic materials like shazam adjusted in French or the Icelandic for next fall.

170
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:43.380
But also older epics like like be off and here i'm i'm brushing a lot of details under the carpet like where we got the data and all that, but I should probably stress that each of these selections would deserve a talk of its own.

171
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:52.200
i'm going to start with a couple of high level statistics on the data, as we have collected it so far, and in this table you see.

172
00:31:53.190 --> 00:32:03.930
The number of texts or works for each of these traditions, the number of documents or the manuscripts and also include these notorious numbers F one F two.

173
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:18.840
Because these numbers give you a pretty good idea already of the general abundance of works in these literature's and then the last column I also is the number of distinct repositories libraries or archives, which these these.

174
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.730
Texts carriers are currently curated kept.

175
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.370
So this is sort of an unconventional way to do a comparative literature.

176
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:38.340
But some interesting trends here can be observed already so first of all, what you see is that Dutch is a very average language in every respect.

177
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:53.010
And French with all of its cultural prestigious clearly the dominant literature in terms of texts and manuscripts you see that German comes in second has a striking the high abundance, so you can see that has a pretty low F1.

178
00:32:54.150 --> 00:33:01.950
So it doesn't have many singleton's Icelandic literature it's not the smallest data set in terms of size but.

179
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:09.990
Like Irish it actually ended up in a remarkably limited number of repositories if you compare this to be your literature's.

180
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:29.580
And then English finally it's actually similar in size to to touch, you could say but works in a corpus have a strikingly low abundance so here, especially the F two is surprisingly low, whereas the other one is unusually high, and of course that will have its effect on the the calculations.

181
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:38.490
So here what you see, is how we plotted to survival rates for each of these literature's and we did that using.

182
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:53.880
Colonel density estimates So what does that mean for for each of the six languages, you will see a colored block and the Beak of those blobs is telling you which values for the survival rate of this literature are most likely.

183
00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.690
And these numbers are expressed as a ratio between zero and one on the horizontal axis.

184
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:11.250
On the left, you see the survival rates that we estimated for for works and on the right, we show those for for documents, these are clearly much lower as opposed to be expected.

185
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:20.700
The dark blue block in the middle for Dutch shows you again how this language is fairly average 50% survival rate for works.

186
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:39.000
But surprisingly French language of high prestige only does a little better and German, for instance comparatively has a much higher survival rate in either graph and what is interesting is that as relatively smaller literature's and you see the Icelandic and Irish.

187
00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:49.890
surviving manuscripts.

188
00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:59.460
So this is comparatively speaking a pretty high survival rates, but what you see, and this is actually looks pretty dramatic.

189
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:08.490
What is dramatic, are the losses that many medieval English literature would have sustained, at least according to this model, those are the.

190
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:20.250
Green blobs with the Left in these graphs so what you can see is that the English here are bottom of the league and which is, of course, related to those extreme F1 F2 values and.

191
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:25.530
We are currently trying to work towards a good explanation for this.

192
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.700
So Icelandic and Irish are really interesting in this experiments.

193
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.040
Because the results that we got for dummies is very interesting from an ecological perspective.

194
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:47.160
So if you ask an ecologist and she or he wouldn't be surprised by these values, because island so i've always sort of played a special role in ecology.

195
00:35:47.520 --> 00:36:05.130
And it is well established that insular are more isolated places on the planet, have always managed to maintain higher levels of what they call endemic species diversity so it's not a coincidence, for instance, that darwin's Galapagos with all their unique species were islands.

196
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:13.020
So perhaps we should be more surprising facts about the low survival rates in england's than the high survival rates in Iceland.

197
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:23.610
But then again maybe England wasn't enough of an island to deserve that title because, after all, the Channel was a seed that was pretty easily crossed in the Middle Ages.

198
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:37.110
And so, one interesting graph to compare these literature's is this one which gives you a so called evenness profile it's very complicated to explain where this graph comes from.

199
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:45.390
But the main thing is that you should see that the curves for Irish an Icelandic and they behave radically different than than the other curves in the graph.

200
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:57.090
So all of these curves start at one, but after that the curse for the elderly literature's quickly drop, whereas you see that, for the other two insular curves devalue stay a much higher.

201
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:04.350
And such an evenness blots is essentially a very complicated way to show that in I sending an Irish.

202
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:12.870
The distribution of documents over works is much more evenly distributed so what you see is that, for instance in in German literature.

203
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:24.510
You have a small number of texts that attract most of the manuscripts So these are the predators, you could say in ecological terms like wolf combination backdate eat up all of the manuscripts.

204
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.170
So this is interesting because.

205
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:38.790
What you see here is that these islands literature's were probably more resilient to loss in the first place so think about that So if you have if you lose an Irish book.

206
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:47.250
It it's much less likely that you also lose a work, and when you lose a book in middle English why because they have more singleton's.

207
00:37:48.450 --> 00:38:04.830
And so interesting when we think about the loss of medieval literature, we are often focused on post medieval factors like the Second World War, but what this result highlights is that the original the medieval shape of these literature's might just be as important.

208
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:18.480
So one aspect that we are also exploring RD dispersal patterns of these fragments are the geography of the repositories repository square these documents eventually ended up.

209
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:26.130
In the heat maps on this slide we sort of visualize the diaspora over the European continent of the text carriers initial.

210
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:36.420
This is for four languages and very preliminary but you see how French and German cover a very similar region they have a similar area surface.

211
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:44.910
But again, he would is remarkable, this is how weird middle English is acting, you can see how few middle English texts have been preserved on the continent.

212
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:57.000
And maybe this is somehow related to the low survival rates that we observed for English literature so maybe the migration or the ability to migrate, that is a relevant concept here.

213
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.300
interesting but puzzling observation.

214
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:06.510
Okay, so time to wrap up what are the main contributions that we hope to make with this work.

215
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:16.920
So, first of all, regarding document loss, the actual last books all of our numbers pretty much corroborate the previous estimates that we have from book historians.

216
00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:24.510
I think the valuable thing here is that we use a completely different technique so that's interesting corroboration.

217
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:39.750
On the other hand, I think it's for the first time that we should be able to provide a large scale estimate of the number of loss works from medieval literature So here we don't even have a proper prior estimates, so this is very novel I think.

218
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:45.090
So third contribution is that in the past, people have mainly thought about.

219
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:53.010
Both medieval factors when they were thinking about the loss of my evil documents, like the wars are the fires that happened after the Middle Ages.

220
00:39:53.700 --> 00:40:09.660
However, with that concept of evenness what we hope to highlight is the importance of the original shape of these literature's, so I think that some literature is for just more resilient to loss in the first place, by the way in which they were constructed.

221
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:20.040
And then, finally, what we hope to push with this researches is a research agenda where culture and ecology or study in a more joined fashion.

222
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:39.120
So I don't think there has to be this big divide between biology and the humanities, and they seem to be many aspects in which we can learn from these fields, learn from one another, so that's it, many thanks for for being here and i'd be happy to to answer questions if there are any.

223
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:44.370
Thanks like.

224
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:46.650
Everyone else's me.
